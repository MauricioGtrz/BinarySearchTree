# BinarySearchTree

Using good coding practices, I created my own binary search tree data structure of integers that consider duplicates, where a parent node has a strictly greater value than left descents and smaller or equal value than right descents. My tree data structure contains classes BinarySearchTree and TreeNode and basic operations, including insert, erase, count, print, smallest.
